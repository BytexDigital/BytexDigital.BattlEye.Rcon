# BytexDigital.BattlEye.Rcon

This library provides an easy way of communicating with a BattlEye RCON server.

## Installation

[nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BytexDigital.BattlEye.Rcon/)

```
Install-Package BytexDigital.BattlEye.Rcon
```

## Usage

#### Creating an RconClient

```cs
RconClient networkClient = new RconClient("127.0.0.1", 2310, "testPassword");
```

#### Connecting

Notice: By default, the RconClient will attempt reconnecting after a initial `Connect()` call or when the client is
disconnected.
You can adjust this behaviour by setting `ReconnectInterval` and `ReconnectOnFailure`.

```cs
// Connect
bool initialConnectSuccessful = networkClient.Connect();

// Optionally make sure we are connected
networkClient.WaitUntilConnected();
```

#### Sending a request that does not expect a response

```cs
networkClient.Send(new SendMessageCommand("This is a global message"));
```

#### Sending a request that returns something

```cs
bool requestSuccess = networkClient.Fetch(
	command: new GetPlayersRequest(),
	timeout: 5000,
	result: out List<Player> onlinePlayers);
```

#### Example: Request players and send everyone with an odd ID a personal message

```cs
bool requestSuccess = networkClient.Fetch(
	command: new GetPlayersRequest(),
	timeout: 5000,
	result: out List<Player> onlinePlayers);

foreach (var player in onlinePlayers.Where(x => x.Id % 2 != 0)) {
	networkClient.Send(new SendMessageCommand(player.Id, "You're a special person"));
}
```

#### Events

A `RconClient` offers the ability to hook up eventhandlers for specific events. The currently implemented events are
when a player connects (`PlayerConnected`), disconnects (`PlayerDisconnected`), when a message not bound to a request is
received ( for example a chat message) (`MessageReceived`) and when a player is removed due to a kick or
ban (`PlayerRemoved`).
